    "## 2.0 To the Frequency Domain! \n",
    "\n",
    "In the class videos, you've seen that sound waves are changes in air pressure (amplitude) over time. In the previous [notebook](sp-m1-1-sounds-signals.ipynb), we saw that we can characterise differences in sounds, particularly _speech sounds_ based on their pitch and spectrogram.  In the next worksheets, we'll look in more depth at how you can decompose a sound wave into simpler sinusoidal parts and how this gets us the spectrogram.  But to do, we first have to deal with the fact that computers only deal with discrete values.  Going from an continuous (i.e. analogue) to a discrete representation brings up a number of issues that you'll need to be aware of when you deal with speech, e.g. aliasing and spectral leakage. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand why these issues arise, you need to know a little bit about the maths behind how we represent and analyze waveforms. So, this is what these notebooks are about!  But don't worry about reproducing the maths or code here.  The goal is to play with these concepts so that you start to develop some intuitions about what sort of analyses you can do, why you see so many different parameters when you look at Praat settings, and the limitations of these standard digital signal processing methods. \n",

    "### Destination: The Discrete Fourier Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools like Praat make it really easy to look at speech from the perspectives of both the time and frequency domain. \n",
    "But if we look 'under the hood', we see that the way we figure out frequency components are present in a specific sound is by using the **Discrete Fourier Transform**.  If you look this up in a text book (e.g. Jurafsky and Martin), you'll see it described like this: \n",

Why are there **exponentials** and **complex numbers** in the formula? What does this $\\varphi$ term represent? What do you have to think about when you're applying this bit of maths? We already saw that there is a trade off between time and frequency resolution (depending on the length of the analysis window). What else do we have to look out for?  \n",
    "\n",
    "The main issue is that in order to analyze a speech on a computer, we have to convert the continuous pressure wave to a discrete representations of (essentially) 1s and 0s.  This comes with a bunch of not so obvious side effects that have a big impact on how we process speech. \n",

We can decompose the waveform on the left into the three on the right. Each of these components has a different **peak amplitude**.  You might also notice that the first and the third components start with value 1 at time zero: they're actually cosine waves.  As we'll see, you can describe a sine wave in terms of the cosine function with a bit of _phase shifting_ (and vice versa).  The main point is that you can break down complicated periodic waveforms into sine wave shaped components representing a pure tone of a specific frequency. For speech sounds, the relative magnitudes of these frequency component affects what phones/words/sentences we hear. \n",

    "## 2.1 Phasors and Sinusoids: tl;dr\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we should say that you can get a conceptual understanding of digital signal processing concepts without going through _all_ the math. We certainly won't be examining your knowledge of complex numbers or geometry in this class.  Of course, if you want to go further in understanding digital signal processing then you will have to learn a bit about complex numbers, algebra, calculus and geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, right now the main point that we'd like you to take away from this notebook is that we can conveniently represent periodic functions in terms of **phasors**: basically what shown on the left hand side of the following gif:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Phasor to sine wave gif](fig/phasor.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of the phasor as an analogue clockface with one moving hand. On the right hand side is a sinusoid, sin(t), which you saw in the previous notebook.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can think of every movement of the 'clockhand' (the phasor is actually this **vector**) as a step in time on the sinusoid graph: at every time step, the phasor rotates by some angle. If you follow the blue dots on both graphs, you should be able to see that the amplitude of the sinusoid matches the height of the 'clockhand' on the phasor at each time step. \n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us a different way of viewing the periodicity of $\\sin(t)$.  The sinusoid starts to repeat itself when the phasor has done one full circle. So, rather than drawing out an infinite time vs amplitude graph, we can capture the behaviour of this periodic function in terms rotations with respect to this finite circle. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, what's the connection with complex numbers?  Well, that blue dot on the phasor actually represents a complex number, and dimensions of that graph are actually the **real** (horizontal) and **imaginary** (vertical) parts of that number.  We'll explain what that means shortly. Quite conveniently, we can express that complex number in terms of a **magnitude** or radius $r$ (length of the clockhand) and a **phase angle** $\\theta$ (angle of rotation from the point (1,0)) and an exponential.  So, we can write each point that the phasor hits in the form $re^{j\\theta}$ - which is what we saw in the DFT formula above! \n",
    "\n",
    "This relationship with complex numbers basically allows us to describe complicated periodic waveforms in terms of combinations of 'pure tone' sinusoids.  It turns out that maths for this works very elegantly using the phasor/complex number based representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this notebook will provide a brief tour of these concepts, from complex numbers to the relationship between phasors and sinusoids via Euler's formula.  This isn't a maths class, so it's fine if you don't get all the details, but we'd suggest you have a read and see how far you get.  The main thing is that you start to make the connection between our clock like phasor and periodic functions in the time domain. \n",
