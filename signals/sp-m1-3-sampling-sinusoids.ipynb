So, how do we generate a phasor with a specific frequency $f$?  Remember, we're dealing with the digital world here, so if we want to analyze a wave, we also need to sample it at a specific **sampling rate**, $f_s$. \n",

    "\n",
    "The units here help us figure this out: the desired frequency $f$ has units cycles/second. So, we can calculate what fraction of a complete cycle we need to take with each sample by multiplying $f$ with the sampling time $t_s$. \n",

    "\n",
    "If you change the frequency (`freq`) for the phasor to be higher than half the sampling rate (`sample_rate/2`), you'll see that the actual frequency of the sinusoid doesn't actually keep getting higher.  In fact, with `freq=8` the sine wave (i.e. projection of the imaginary component) doesn't appear to have any amplitude modulation at all.  However, keen readers will note that for this `freq=8` example, the real projection (i.e. cosine) would show amplitude modulations since cos(t) is 90 degree phase shifted relative to sine(t). The phasor `freq=15` appears to complete only one cycle per second, just like for `freq=1`.  \n",

This is one of the most important concepts in digital signal processing and will effect pretty much all the methods we use.  So, if you remember just one thing, remember this! \n",
