    "into individual speech sounds based on the shape of the waveform, and\n",

    "need a refresher on how to complete any of the following steps, refer to\n",
    "tutorial 0: [Get Praat](phon-0-getPraat.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Open the sound file scanit.wav into the Praat Objects window.\n",

    "2.  Create a TextGrid with one interval tier named \\\"segments\\\".\n",

    "3.  Show the waveform (hide the spectrogram)\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  View and edit the waveform and TextGrid together.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Use the visual appearance of the waveform to segment the sound file\n",
    "    into the major classes of speech sound (plosive, fricative, sonorant\n",
    "    (in this case nasal), and vowel). Refer to the video on waveforms\n",
    "    and speech sounds if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Label the segments using appropriate IPA symbols for the sound that\n",
    "    occurs in each interval. You may do this in any of the following\n",
    "    ways, listed in order of increasing complexity:\n",

    "\tto select the\n",
    "        IPA symbols you require, then copy & paste them into the\n",
    "        relevant segment. (This is the simplest solution and the one I\n",
    "        recommend if you are not feeling adventurous.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.  Use Praat\n",
    "        [trigraphs](http://uvafon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manual/Phonetic_symbols.html)\n",
